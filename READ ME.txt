Put either the CRUELTY DEATH or CRUELTY LIFE folder into your custom folder depending on which health bubble/colors you prefer.

Using the command "cl_hud_minmode 0" gives you a CRUELTY SQUAD accurate HUD. "cl_hud_minmode 1" gives you a slightly more competitively viable HUD.

The border can be changed or disabled by editing the "borders.res" file in "customizations/borders" folder.
The HUD crosshair and hitmarker can be changed or disabled by editing the "crosshairs.res" file in the "customizations/crosshairs" folder.
The health bubble can be made static or disabled by editing the "health bubble.res" file in the "customizations/health bubble" folder.
The ammo friend can be killed by editing the "ammo friend.res" file in the "customizations/ammo friend" folder.
The scoreboard can be swapped between 12v12 or 6v6 by editing the "scoreboard.res" file in the "customizations/scoreboard" folder.

I made this HUD on 1920x1080, the borders and crosshairs will not work correctly on other resolutions.

Optional hitsound and killsound included, they can be installed by putting the hitsound.wav and/or killsound.wav file(s) into the "custom/customfolder/sound/ui" folder (the customfolder name is just an example, mine is just named damage).
Optional vtf crosshair included for people looking to use different colors or a crosshair switcher instead of a hud crosshair.
